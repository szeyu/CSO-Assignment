# WIX1003 Computer Systems & Organization Lab Assignment

## Introduction
This repository contains the lab assignment for the course WIX1003 Computer Systems and Organization. This assignment serves as a mini project where a group of students collaborates to address a specific problem. The details of the problem and the objectives can be found in the following sections.

## Objective
The main objectives of this lab assignment are:
- Stimulate creativity and innovation among students.
- Enhance students' understanding of the studied subject.

## Background and Requirement

### Status of Encounter
The task assigned to our team is to develop a prototype of a new computer system capable of controlling a cross-junction traffic. The objective is to produce a working demo of a traffic light control system for the given cross junction.

#### Minimal Requirement
A microprocessor or microcontroller system must be used for this project. The system will control a tri-colour traffic light indicator (green, yellow, red) for each junction, allowing equal chances for users to exit and cross the junction safely.

- Green: Permission to go
- Yellow: Prepare to stop
- Red: Stop and wait

#### Additional Feature Suggestion
To enhance user experience, a countdown indicator is suggested to inform users of the remaining wait time before permission to proceed is granted.

## Submission
